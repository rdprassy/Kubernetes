minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox   (starting the minikube)

minikube docker-env  (get all the required parameters to export so that you can use the docker that comes with the minikube rather than your local docker)

docker image ls (get the docker images, the following images are required to get the docker images)

docker image pull richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0-5  ( pulls the docker image from hub.docker.com)

docker container run -p 80:80  -d richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0-5  (if image not present in pulls automaticaly, left part is the exposed port )

docker container rm d72657442f5d   (stopping a docker container)

docker container rm d72657442f5d  (removing a docker container)

if the docker containers keeps on increasing, it is difficult to manage so usage of kubernetes. usally we have one container in a pod , but we can have many like helper containers which we call sidecars.

A pod is a wrapper over docker container. basic unit of deployment.

better to increase tag names to increased releases of docker containers.

kubectl get all  (get all the pods and services running)

kubectl exec webapp ls (executes the pod where name is webapp and runs ls)

kubectl -it exec webapp sh  (opens the shell in a interactive mode)
