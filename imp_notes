(starting the minikube) 

minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox    

  

(get all the required parameters to export so that you can use the docker that comes with the minikube rather than your local docker) 

minikube docker-env    

 

(get the docker images, the following images are required to get the docker images) 

docker image ls 

 

 ( pulls the docker image from hub.docker.com) 

docker image pull richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0-5 

    

(if image not present in pulls automaticaly, left part is the exposed port ) 

docker container run -p 80:80  -d richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0-5    

  

removing a docker container) 

docker container rm d72657442f5d    

 

if the docker containers keeps on increasing, it is difficult to manage so usage of kubernetes. usally we have one container in a pod , but we can have many like helper containers which we call sidecars. 

  

A pod is a wrapper over docker container. basic unit of deployment. 

  

better to increase tag names to increased releases of docker containers. 

  

get all the pods and services running) 

kubectl get all    

 

(executes the pod where name is webapp and runs ls) 

kubectl exec webapp ls   

 

(opens the shell in a interactive mode) 

kubectl -it exec webapp sh   

 

Kubernetes service 

 

Pod is a logical unit. Inorder to expose our web application. We need to ensure we expose it to the outer world. We created a Service. 

 

Bydefault the target port defaults the port . 

 

Services are long lived entities. Whereas pods are ephemeral. 

 

Gets the ip of minikube 

minikube ip 

 

Usage of service – create different services and switch between them because of labels. Faster way so that you don’t wait for the pod to be killed and the new image being downloaded.
